# Project Overview
This repository hosts a Node.js project aimed at creating a GraphQL API. Below is an outline of the motivation behind this project:

# Project Motivation
In the course of my development journey, I've encountered various approaches to building APIs. Some projects involved traditional REST API development, while others explored different paradigms such as webhook APIs and integration with technologies like Socket.IO.

Through these experiences, I've come to realize the diverse landscape of API protocols, including REST, webhooks, GraphQL, SOAP, and WebSockets, among others. This realization sparked a curiosity to delve deeper into understanding the necessity and evolution of APIs.

This project serves as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of APIs and broaden my perspective on their significance in modern software development. By venturing into GraphQL, a paradigm I haven't extensively explored before, I aim to compare and contrast its approach with the familiar REST API model. Ultimately, I seek to gain insights and proficiency in API design and implementation, enriching my skill set as a developer.
